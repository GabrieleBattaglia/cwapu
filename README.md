# CWapu by Gabriele Battaglia (IZ4APU)
This is a collection of exercises to improve your skill on receiving CW (Morse Code) by ears.

## Be sure to have GBUtils.py in the same folder of cwapu.py You can grab it from the GBUtils project on GitHub.

# A special thanks to Mr. Kevin Schmidt W9CF for the module that produce and play CW.
Without you, dear friend Kevin, I couldn't have fun with these toys. many, many thanks.

## Reset log.
To start over with your exercise log, just delete .pkl and txt file from the cwapu folder. Cwapu recreate them from scratch and counters will be reset.

## Words exercise
The word reception function requires the words.txt file, which must be located in the same folder as cwapu.py or cwapu.exe. This file should be written in plain text, encoded in UTF-8, and must contain a single word per line. Currently, cwapu.exe provides a dictionary for the Italian language with over 700,000 words. 
You can, of course, replace it with anything you find in the language you wish to practice, as long as it meets the aforementioned characteristics. 
I owe the Italian language dictionary to *Piero Tofy*, whom I thank wholeheartedly.

## Counting Exercise
This part of the program is simply used to track any activity that requires a positive or negative response. For example, you might want to listen to words or groups in CW and tell the computer whether you understood the group or not. If you did, press the space bar; if not, press another key, and to finish, press Esc.
At the end, you will see a report indicating the total attempts, successful ones, failed ones, and the corresponding percentages.
As always, you can add a comment and save everything in the exercise journal so that you can track your improvements over time.

Sure, here's the translation:

## Transmission Exercise
In this exercise, CWAPU will provide you with calls-like and a numerical sequence, both entirely fictional but useful for practicing on your CW key.
When you participate in a contest or DX-Expedition, the skill required is to listen to QRZs and send them in CW quickly and without errors. Here, you can practice reading the calls on the screen and reproducing them in telegraphy.
As always, press Esc to end the exercise.
