"The WordsCreator procedure allows you to scan all the txt files contained"
" in the folders you indicate and add all the words from those files to "
"words.txt. The words will be added uniquely, meaning they will all be "
"different from each other.\n"
"The file produced by this process will be named words_updated.txt. Check "
"it with a text editor and, if you are satisfied with it, rename it to "
"words.txt, replacing the existing words.txt.\n"
"You can repeat this operation as many times as you like: "
"words_updated.txt will contain the words from words.txt plus all those "
"collected from the newly processed .txt files."
