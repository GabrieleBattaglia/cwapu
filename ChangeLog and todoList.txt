CWAPU WHATSNEW AND TODO
Todo:
	1.
ChangeLog:
	Important before switching from 2.x to 3.x version:
		run migrate within the same folder as cwapu.exe. If you got a good response, you may delete it and all 	the .pkl file as cwapu will use cwapu_settings.json as its default saved settings file.
	3.0.1
	= Fixed a non-global variable in R.5 section
	3.0.0
		+ Added migrate.py to switch from 2 to 3 version of cwapu, please run migrate.py (or .exe) then delete it.
		+ switched from pickle to json and unified all settings for better and more easy implementations
		+ Improved calculation for mistake in r exercise
		+ New cw engine by GBUtile/CWzator
